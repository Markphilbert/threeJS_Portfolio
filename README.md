<h2>ThreeJS Portfolio</h2>

A portfolio website created using ThreeJS and React.

This project is hosted on Netlify.
Link: https://shoesoverflow.netlify.app/

<h3>Description</h3>

This was created using React for the sole purpose of picking up and learning React, ThreeJS and TailwindCSS.

<h3>How It's Made:</h3>

This Project was created with: 
<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>ThreeJS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>TailwindCSS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimizations</h3>

Currently I have no plans to further optimize this site. It was initially created to replace my old portfolio but I thought I may as well use it to learn new skills. I also considered replacing some of the 3D models but had trouble finding ones I liked.  

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Through creating this project I learned several React and ThreeJS topics. React was not too different from VUE so it was straightforward to learn, however ThreeJS and using 3D models in general was a big learning curve. There were several times I had to troubleshoot to get the 3D elements to do what I needed and wanted them to do. I also dived deeper into TailwindCSS which is something I've used before and studied but never had a chance to build anything relevant with.
