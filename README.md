This is my portfolio created using React and a ThreeJS Library.

This project is hosted on Netlify.

<h3>Description</h3>

This was created using React for the sole purpose of picking up and learning 3D Models. A ThreeJS Library was used in completing this project.

<h3>How It's Made:</h3>

This Project was created with: 
<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>ThreeJS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimizations</h3>

I plan to find other 3D models. I also would like if I could do more than just a rotation. I like how it currently looks but I think it would be cool to have it do so much more.  

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Through creating this project I learned several React topics as well as a lot about working with 3D websites. There were times when implementing lighting was become a struggle and I had to do a lot of research to get the models to be properly seen. While building this was a lot of fun, it was also very educational understanding there is more to 3D models than pasting in a link to an image as you would in a 2D site.
